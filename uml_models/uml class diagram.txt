Data Retriever: This class retrieves patient data upon request. It verifies the user token to ensure authorised access to patient information.
DataStorage: This class stores and provides access to patient data. It holds a map of patient IDs to corresponding patient data.
PatientData: This class represents a patient's data record. It includes patient ID, vital signs, and medical history.
AlertManager: This class manages alerts generated from patient data. It has a list of alerts and methods to add new alerts and send them out.
Alert: This class represents an alert generated from patient data. It includes patient ID, timestamp, and the type of alert.
PatientIdentifier: This class seems to be an utility class that helps match patient data based on an ID.

The sequence of interactions might be as follows:

The Data Retriever receives a request for patient data along with a user token.
The Data Retriever verifies if the user is authorised to access the data.
If authorised, the Data Retriever fetches data from the DataStorage using the patient ID.
The DataStorage retrieves the data based on the patient ID and returns it to the Data Retriever.
The Data Retriever then returns the patient data.
Separately, the system monitors patient data and generates alerts (likely based on pre-defined criteria). These alerts are managed by the AlertManager.
The AlertManager can send out the alerts through a mechanism not shown in the UML diagram.
